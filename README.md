# C-Image-Printing-Coding-Project-Creating-Beautiful-Images 
This project focuses on creating images programmatically by writing pixel data to files in PGM (grayscale) and PPM (color) formats. Through a series of coding tasks, you’ll practice using coordinate systems, generating geometric shapes, constructing fractals, and visualizing complex mathematical sets.

You will:
	•	Create simple images like squares and circles.
	•	Recreate national flags.
	•	Generate fractals, including Sierpinski carpets and Mandelbrot-like sets.
	•	Practice recursion, iteration, and file output for images.
The following is organized as followed :

How to Run the Code

Requirements
	•	C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
	•	Basic file I/O knowledge in C++
	•	GIMP or any image viewer that can open .pgm and .ppm files
	•	(Optional) Online converter for .ppm/.pgm to .png (example tool)

Compilation

Each .cpp file can be compiled with:
g++ code.cpp -o output
To run the code:
./output

Depending on the problem:
	•	Some programs generate the output file automatically (output.pgm or output.ppm).
	•	Some programs ask for user input (e.g., carpet order for fractals).

After running, open the generated .pgm or .ppm with an image viewer.
